        <p className="text-red-600 text-bjjred">The philosophy of Jiu-Jitsu defines the state of mind that a warrior should adopt in combat to enable victory; it is a philosophy of yielding to an opponent's force, instead of trying to oppose force with force. Ultimately, the fundamentals for good Jiu-Jitsu are also the fundamentals of good character.</p>
